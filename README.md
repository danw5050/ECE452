uWaterloo CS446/ECE452 Android Application

TAPP, is to make other peopleâ€™s already complex life a little easy. TAPP involves both, a hardware and software component. The idea here is to first place a bunch of cheap NFC (Near Field Communication) tags across your house or office workspace. Our application would let you configure what you wish to do when you TAPP your phone against one of these NFC tags. This spans a variety of options such as setting an alarm for the next day, placing your phone on silent mode when you are at work or turning on Spotify when you are just chilling in your living room. Next, when you TAPP your phone against one of these NFC tags, our application would kick in, identify the ID for this NFC tag, look for a corresponding action to be performed based on the ID and would accordingly perform the task.
